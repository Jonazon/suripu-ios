The ideal temperature for this is generally between 59 and 68 degrees Fahrenheit. While cooler temperatures are generally better than warmer ones, be careful not to set your thermostat too low. A bedroom that’s uncomfortably hot or cold can disrupt your sleep cycle, which can negatively impact the quality of your sleep.";
"sensor.section.about.humidity" = "The ideal humidity for a good night’s sleep is around 50%. In addition to affecting the quality of your sleep, low humidity can cause your throat to become irritated and your skin to become dry, while high humidity can make it harder for moisture to evaporate off your body — making you hot, uncomfortable, and sweaty. Damp air can also encourage mold growth, which may affect your sleep if you suffer from mold allergies.";
"sensor.section.about.sound" = "A noisy environment can make it difficult to fall asleep, but the impact of sound on your quality of sleep doesn’t end there.

The AQI shows you how clean or polluted the air is in your area by measuring the concentration of pollutants in the air, as well potential corresponding effects the air might have on your health. Poor air quality has been correlated with increased risk of poor sleep, and sustained levels of poor air quality can be detrimental to your overall health.";
"sensor.section.about.tvoc" = "Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) can be essential ingredients in many household products, such as cleansers, disinfectants, mattresses, fresh paint, and more. Indoors, normal atmospheric conditions can cause these compounds to evaporate into the air, which in large concentrations can have a detrimental effect on overall air quality, and your health. VOCs may lead to irritated eyes, headaches, allergies, or asthma which may in turn impact the quality of your sleep.";
"sensor.section.about.light" = "Light is the primary signal for your circadian rhythm, which governs not only your sleep, but also your mood, appetite, and more. In the morning, light prompts your body to wake up, while in the evening, the decrease in light signals to your body that it’s time to wind down, relax, and prepare for sleep. Being exposed to too little light in the morning or too much at night can confuse this rhythm and make it much harder to maintain a healthy sleep schedule.";

The greenhouse gas carbon dioxide (CO2) is naturally part of Earth’s atmosphere, and CO2 emissions come from a variety of natural sources. However, human activity such as fuel combustion for energy and transportation increases the amount of CO2 present in the atmosphere. High concentrations of CO2 can make the air feel stuffy and stale, which can be solved by opening a window to let in some fresh air. Extremely high concentrations of CO2 can be hazardous to your health, so consider investing in a dedicated CO2 monitor to help you determine whether a rising concentration of CO2 is approaching dangerous levels.";

As daylight is a cool color (starting at around 2,000 K during sunrise and sunset and peaking at around 10,000 on a clear blue day), your body uses blue light as a primary signal for your circadian rhythm, suppressing melatonin and keeping you alert during the day. Personal electronics and televisions also generally give off blue light, which means that using these devices before bed can adversely affect your sleep schedule, keeping you awake when you’re trying to get to sleep.";
