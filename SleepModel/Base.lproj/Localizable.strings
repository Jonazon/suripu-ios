The ideal temperature for this is generally between 15 and 20 degrees Celsius. While cooler temperatures are generally better than warmer ones, be careful not to set your thermostat too low. A bedroom that’s uncomfortably hot or cold can disrupt your sleep cycle, which can negatively impact the quality of your sleep.";

The ideal temperature for this is generally between 59 and 68 degrees Fahrenheit. While cooler temperatures are generally better than warmer ones, be careful not to set your thermostat too low. A bedroom that’s uncomfortably hot or cold can disrupt your sleep cycle, which can negatively impact the quality of your sleep.";
"sensor.section.about.humidity" = "The ideal humidity for a good night’s sleep is around 50%. In addition to affecting the quality of your sleep, low humidity can cause your throat to become irritated and your skin to become dry, while high humidity can make it harder for moisture to evaporate off your body — making you hot, uncomfortable, and sweaty. Damp air can also encourage mold growth, which may affect your sleep if you suffer from mold allergies.";
"sensor.section.about.sound" = "A noisy environment can make it difficult to fall asleep, but the impact of sound on your quality of sleep doesn’t end there. Even if you manage to doze off, your brain continues to register and process sounds, meaning nighttime noise can disrupt your sleep even if it doesn’t wake you up.";

The AQI shows you how clean or polluted the air is in your area, as well as potential corresponding effects the air might have on your health. The AQI is calculated using five major pollutants: ground-level ozone, particle pollution (or particulate matter), carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen dioxide. Poor air quality has been correlated with increased risk of poor sleep, and sustained levels of poor air quality can be detrimental to your overall health.";
"sensor.section.about.tvoc" = "Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) can be essential ingredients in many household products, such as cleansers, disinfectants, mattresses, fresh paint, and more. Indoors, normal atmospheric conditions can cause these compounds to evaporate into the air, which in large concentrations can have a detrimental effect on overall air quality, and your health. VOCs may lead to irritated eyes, headaches, allergies, or asthma which may in turn impact the quality of your sleep.";
"sensor.section.about.light" = "Light is the primary signal for your circadian rhythm, which governs not only your sleep, but also your mood, appetite, and more. In the morning, light prompts your body to wake up, while in the evening, the decrease in light signals to your body that it’s time to wind down, relax, and prepare for sleep. Being exposed to too little light in the morning or too much at night can confuse this rhythm and make it much harder to maintain a healthy sleep schedule.";

The greenhouse gas carbon dioxide (CO2) is naturally part of Earth’s atmosphere, and CO2 emissions come from a variety of natural sources. However, human activity such as fuel combustion for energy and transportation increases the amount of CO2 present in the atmosphere, and high concentrations can impair brain activity and make it difficult to breathe, which could affect sleep quality.";
"sensor.section.about.uv" = "A sunny day can be enjoyable, but too much sunlight can be dangerous. The sun’s rays give off ultraviolet (UV) radiation, and it’s this radiation that makes overexposure to sunlight damaging to your skin, causing sunburns and putting you at higher risk for skin cancer. Seasonal weather conditions combined with ozone depletion can cause different amounts of UV radiation to reach different regions at different times. The UV Index exists to provide a daily forecast of the severity of UV radiation in your area.";
"sensor.section.about.light_temp" = "Light temperatures over 4,500 K are described as cool colors (or blue light) and temperatures between 2,000–3,000 K described as warm colors (or red light). As daylight is a cool color (starting at around 2,000 K during sunrise and sunset and peaking at around 10,000 on a clear blue day), your body uses blue light as a primary signal for your circadian rhythm, suppressing melatonin and keeping you alert during the day. Personal electronics and televisions also generally give off blue light, which means that using these devices before bed can adversely affect your sleep schedule, keeping you awake when you’re trying to get to sleep.";
