* [Build Release Checklist](https://hello.hackpad.com/iOS-Release-Checklist-6xtI96xm7kx)

### Branching

We are using [git flow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/).

All new code is added to branches forked from the `develop` branch, which is where everyday action happens. When releases are immiment, develop is merged into `master` and tagged with the latest version.
